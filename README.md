# KarayollariProject (Highways Route Simulator)

A Java-based simulation tool that generates random travel routes between cities and calculates total traversal distances. This project demonstrates algorithmic logic for handling location data and cumulative calculations.

##  Project Overview
"Karayollari" is Turkish for *Highways*. This application simulates a journey by selecting a random starting city and calculating the distance to subsequent destinations. It is designed to model basic logistics and path calculation logic.

###  Key Features
* **Randomized Path Generation:** Algorithmically selects a random starting city and subsequent destinations.
* **Distance Calculation:** Computes the distance between the current city and the next target, accumulating a total travel distance for the trip.
* **Route Simulation:** Simulates a 10-step journey (or specific trip duration) to model travel costs.

##  Built With
* **Language:** Java
* **Concepts:** Arrays/ArrayLists, Randomization (`java.util.Random`), Control Flow Loops, Iterative Logic.

##  How to Run
To run this project on your local machine, ensure you have the [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) installed.

1.  **Clone the repository**
